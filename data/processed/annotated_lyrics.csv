Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again? Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight? I wonder if you are lonesome tonight You know someone said that the world's a stage, and each must play a part Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart Act one was where we met I loved you at first glance You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue Then came act two You seemed to change, you acted strange And why I've never known Honey, you lied when you said you loved me And I had no cause to doubt you But I'd rather go on hearing your lies Than to go on living without you Now the stage is bare, and I'm standing there With emptiness all around And if you won't come back to me Then they can bring the curtain down Is your heart filled with pain?

By the way, sweetheart, what's your name? She said: My friends like to call me Exotic Elaine I said: My name is the Prince and she said: Why? I said: Well, I don't know, I'm just a hell of a guy! But enough about me, yo, let's talk about you And all the wonderful things that you and I can do I popped some trash and in a little bit of time I showed some cash and the girl was mine I took her over town, I wined her and dined her She asked me 'did I like her?' I said: Well... kinda All of a sudden, she jumped out her seat Snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street She started grabbin all over me, kissin' and huggin' So I shoved her away, I said: You better stop buggin'! She got mad, looked me dead in my face Threw her hands in the air and yelled out: Rape! I got scared when she started to yell So I handed her my wallet and ran like hell I was duckin' through alleys right and left But when the cops caught up, they almost beat me to death I was arrested, charged with aggravated assault Hey, yo Clancy, we got him! But it wasn't my fault! Nevertheless, don't mean to bust your bubble But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble So next time a girl gives you the play Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away I was in a bar one Friday night Coolin', watchin' a Mike Tyson fight I was maxin' and relaxin', sippin' on tequila When this girl walked up, she said: Hi, my name is Sheila I responded by saying hello She paid for my drink and then said: Let's go 20 minutes later, things were starting to cook As we pulled up into her house, I said: I'm with you, toots The music was soft and there was wine in the glasses She started winking and making little passes At me, she grabbed me close and that's when she got bold She started feeling up my back, I said: Oh, your hands are cold! We went into her bedroom thinking of one thing Took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring I carresed her body and I kissed her cheek And that's when I observed those satin bed sheets I felt that it was time for me to make my move I thought I better hurry up before I busted the groove I leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue A door slammed and a voice said: Baby, where are you? Her boyfriend busted in, he grinned an evil grin And said: Boy, I'mma tear your butt limb from limb! I was scared as hell, where was I supposed to go? I just yelled: Geronimo! and jumped out the window Just my luck we were in a snow storm And all I had was my underwear on to keep me warm And to top the night off, I had to break in my place Because my keys were in my pants back on Sheila's book case I was done, sneezin' and coughin'... Aaa-choo! I hope this doesn't happen too often, but Nevertheless, don't mean to bust your bubble But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble So next time a girl gives you the play Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away I got a ring on my phone, May 5th last year It was my girlfriend Betty, I said: Hello dear! I was just about to call you I got a couple tickets to the Run-D.M.C. concert I'm wit' it It's six o'clock now, at eight will you be ready? Yeah Aight, fine, see you then, Betty I combed my hair, washed, and brushed my teeth Got funky fresh dressed in my Le Coq Sportif Got to Betty's at eight, I was ready to jet Until Betty's mom said: Betty's not ready yet! I sat there for at least an hour It was ten after nine before she got in the shower 9:35, she comes downstairs And said: I need a little longer to finish my hair At ten o'clock, we had been missed the show She comes downstairs and says 'let's go'!? Go where? Go to sleep, I'm gone! I was steamin' like a demon as I drove home But it just goes to show not trying to bust your bubble But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble So next time a girl gives you the play Just remember my rhyme Just remember my rhymes Take heed to my rhymes and get the hell away!",1987,0.09105374280230326,-0.027460652591170823,0.0021938579654510594,0.5961098398169337,angry

And if he don't say, Moe Dee I'll take my whip and make him call himself Toby Whip him good, then I'll make him sweat Always talkin' about battles and never had a battle yet But if we ever did, how could you beat me?

hip-hop,The Pharcyde,Passin' Me By,"Now, in my younger days, I used to sport a shag When I went to school, I'd carry lunch in a bag With a apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss Always got mad when the class was dismissed But when it was in session, I always had a question I would raise my hand, to make her stand, come to my desk, and Help me with my problem, it was never much Just a trick to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug She was married to the man, he was a thug His name was Lee, he drove a Z He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock I was on her jock, yes, indeedy, I wrote graffiti on the bus First, I'd write her name, then carve a plus With my name last, on the looking glass I seen her yesterday, but still, I had to let her pass She keeps on passin' me by! Uh, bye... She keeps on passin' me by! But nevertheless, I'll say it again She keeps on passin' me by! Yes she does... But nevertheless, I'll say it again that– She keeps on pass— When I dream of fairy tales, I think of me and Shelly See, she's my type of hype, and I can't stand when brothers tell me That I should quit chasin' and look for something better But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her I just play love by the ear and hope she gets the picture I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger She could be my broad, and I could be her— And I could be her... All I could do was stare Back as kids, we used to kiss when we played Truth Or Dare Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer To get in her book, and it looks rather dry I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try and stop the stride 'Cause I won't have no more of this passin' me by Time for me to voice my opinion, can't be pretending she didn't have me Sprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan Damn, she looked good, downside, she had a man He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop She told me Soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand By letting her pass, I'd prove to be a better man She keeps on passin' me by! Passin' me by... She keeps on passin' me by! But nevertheless, I'll say it again She keeps on passin' me by! But nevertheless, I'll say it again Passin' me by-aye-aye... She keeps on passin' me— Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when– Ever she happens to walk by, why does the apple of my eye Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try? Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence From a distance, I desired her, secretly admired her Wired her a letter, to get her, and it went: My dear, my dear, my dear You do not know me, but I know you very well Now let me tell you 'bout the feelings I feel for you When I try or make some sort of attempt, I simp Damn, I wish I wasn't such a wimp 'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so And if I was your man, then I would be true The only lying I would do is in the bed with you Then I signed: Sincerely The one who loves you dearly P.S. Love Me Tender But the letter came back three days later: Return to Sender Damn... She keeps on passin' me by! She keeps on passin' me by! But nevertheless, I'll say it again She keeps on passin' me by! But nevertheless, I'll say it again that– She keeps on passin' me by! But nevertheless, I'll say it again that– She keeps on pass— But nevertheless, I'll say it again She keeps passing me by-aye-aye-aye... But nevertheless, I'll say it again Yeah... But nevertheless— Bye... But nevertheless— Woo!
