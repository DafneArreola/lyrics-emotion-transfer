She said, Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy They'll be nice to you She said, Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down Lord, forgive me for what I do But if you want out, well, it's up to you Now don't let me down now Your Mama's gonna move you uptown Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma The night I left that rickety shack The welfare people came and took the baby Mama died and I ain't been back But the wheels of fate had started to turn And for me there was no way out It wasn't very long until I knew exactly What my Mama'd been talking about I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow That I was gonna be a lady someday Though I didn't know when or how But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life With my head hung down in shame You know I might've been born just plain white trash But Fancy was my name She said, Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down She said, Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down It wasn't long after a benevolent man Took me in off the streets And one week later I was pouring his tea In a five-room hotel suite Yes, she was I charmed a king, congressman And an occasional aristocrat Then I got me a Georgia mansion And an elegant New York townhouse flat And I ain't done bad She ain't done bad Now in this world There's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites that call me bad They criticize Mama for turning me out No matter how little we had But though I ain't had to worry about nothing For nigh on fifteen years Well, I can still hear the desperation In my poor Mama's voice ringing in my ears Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down Oh, here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down Lord, forgive me for what I do But if you want out, well, it's up to you Now don't let me down, hon' Your Mama's gonna move you uptown Oh, and I guess she did",

One of the greatest guitar players as well as songwriters and singers in the business. Appreciate a little help on the guitar, all right? Well, my daddy left home when I was three And he didn't leave much to ma and me Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid But the meanest thing that he ever did Was before he left, he went and named me Sue Well, he must've thought that it was quite a joke And it got a lot of laughs from a lots of folks It seems I had to fight my whole life through Some gal would giggle and I'd get red And some guy'd laugh then I'd bust his head I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean My fists got hard and my wits got keen Roamed from town to town to hide my shame But I made me a vow to the Moon and stars I'd search the honky-tonks and bars And kill the man who gave me that awful name Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July And I just hit town and my throat was dry I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew At an old saloon on a street of mud There at a table, dealing stud Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye He was big and bent and gray and old And I looked at him and my blood ran cold And I said, My name is Sue! How do you do? Now you gonna die! Yeah, that's what I told him! Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes And he went down, but to my surprise He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear But I busted a chair right across his teeth And we crashed through the wall and into the street Kicking and a-gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer I tell you, I've fought tougher men But I really can't remember when He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss And he went for his gun and I pulled mine first He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile And he said, Son, this world is rough And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough And I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along So I give you that name and I said goodbye I knew you'd have to get tough or die And it's that name that helped to make you strong Yeah He said, Now you just fought one hell of a fight And I know you hate me and you got the right To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do But you ought to thank me, before I die For the gravel in your guts and the spit in your eye Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue Yeah, but what could I do? What could I do? I got all choked up and I threw down my gun And I called him my pa, and he called me a son And I came away with a different point of view And I think about him, now and then Every time I try and every time I win And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him Bill or George!

Well, I come from the country, and I know I ain't seen it all But I heard that ocean's salty, and the stars, they sometimes fall. And that would not do justice to the way I feel for you So I had to sing this song about all the things I knew My love is deeper than the holler. Stronger than the river Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill My love is purer than the snowflakes, That fall in late December And honest as a Robin on a springtime window sill And longer than the song of a whippoorwill. From the back roads to the Broadway shows with a million miles between There's a least a million love songs that people love to sing And every one is different, and every one's the same And this is just another way of sayin' the same thing My love is deeper than the holler Stronger than the river Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill My love is purer than the snowflakes That fall in late December And honest as a Robin on a spring-time window sill And longer than the song of a whippoorwill My love is deeper than the holler Stronger than the river Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill My love is purer than the snowflakes That fall in late December And honest as a Robin on a spring-time window sill And longer than the song of a whippoorwill A Whippoorwill",

Ghost riders in the sky Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat He's ridin' hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet 'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cry As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name If you want to save your soul from Hell, a-ridin' on our range Then cowboy, change your ways today, or with us you will ride Tryin' to catch the Devil's herd, across these endless skies Yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!

Are we gonna do this or what? I think you know I like you a lot But you're about to miss your shot Are you gonna kiss me or what? It was the best dang kiss that I ever had Except for that long one after that And I knew if I wanted this thing to last Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand So I took a chance Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee And you smiled and said to me Are you gonna kiss me or not? Are we gonna do this or what? I think you know I love you a lot I think we've got a real good shot Are you gonna kiss me or not? So we planned it all out for the middle of June From the wedding cake to the honeymoon And your momma cried When you walked down the aisle When the preacher man said, Say I do I did and you did too Then I lifted that veil And saw your pretty smile and I said Are you gonna kiss me or not? Are we gonna do this or what? Look at all the love that we got It ain't never gonna stop Are you gonna kiss me or not? Yeah baby I love you a lot I really think we've got a shot Are you gonna kiss me or not?",

There might be a little dust on the bottle But don't let it fool you about what's inside There might be a little dust on the bottle But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time You're still with me and we've made some memories After all these years, there's one thing I've found Some say good love, well it's like a fine wine It keeps getting better as the days go by There might be a little dust on the bottle But don't let it fool you about what's inside There might be a little dust on the bottle But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time There might be a little dust on the bottle But don't let it fool you about what's inside There might be a little dust on the bottle But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time Don't let it fool you!",

She asked so sweet and tenderly Do you know, do you know You Are My Sunshine And would you do it one more time for me? Border to border and ocean to ocean I still look for her every place Chasing the sunshine, each and every night I'm Searching every crowd for her face She was gone just as quick as the song that she asked for Taking my sunshine away But someday when I finally look down and see her I know just what I'm gonna say Do you know, do you know you are my sunshine? Do you know what your smile did to me? Do you know, do you know you are my sunshine? And it looks like you're always going to be Do you know, do you know you are my sunshine? Do you know what your smile did to me? Do you know, do you know you are my sunshine? And would you do it one more time for me? Do you know, do you know you are my sunshine?",

And he said That's my job, that's what I do Everything I do is because of you, to keep you safe with me That's my job, you see. Later we barely got along, this teenage boy and he Most of the fights it seems were over different dreams We each held for me He wanted knowledge and learning, I wanted to fly out west I said I could make it out there, if I just had the fare I got half, will you loan me the rest? And I said, Daddy, I'm so afraid There's no guarantee in the plans I've made And if I should fail, who will pay my way back home? And he said That's my job, that's what I do Everything I do is because of you, to keep you safe with me That's my job, you see. Every person carves his spot, and fills the hole with life And I pray someday I might, light as bright as he Woke up early one bright fall day, read the tragic news After all my travels, I settled down, within a mile or two I make my livin' with words and rhymes, and all this tragedy Should go into my head and out instead, as bits of poetry But I say, Daddy I'm so afraid How will I go on, with you gone this way How can I come up, with a song to say, I love you.

And does the mystery deepen Cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time? Somewhere in my deepest thoughts Familiar scenes and memories unfold These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long But I have never told Like every time I fly up through the heavens And I see you there below I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso El Paso City, by the Rio Grande Could it be, that I could be The cowboy in this mystery That died there in that desert sand so long ago? El Paso City, by the Rio Grande A voice tells me to go and see Another voice, keeps tellin' me Maybe death awaits me in El Paso El Paso City.....",

            "lyrics": "Look at the two of you dancing that way Lost in the moment and each other's face So much in love, you're alone in this place Like there's nobody else in the world I was enough for her not long ago I was her number one, she told me so And she still means the world to me, just so you know So be careful when you hold my girl Time changes everything, life must go on And I'm not going to stand in your way But I loved her first, I held her first And a place in my heart will always be hers From the first breath she breathed When she first smiled at me I knew the love of a father runs deep And I prayed that she'd find you someday But it still hard to give her away, I loved her first How could that beautiful woman with you Be the same freckle-face kid that I knew The one that I read all those fairy tales to And tucked into bed all those nights And I knew the first time I saw you with her It was only a matter of time But I loved her first and I held her first And a place in my heart will always be hers From the first breath she breathed When she first smiled at me I knew the love of a father runs deep And I prayed that she'd find you someday But its still hard to give her away, I loved her first From the first breath she breathed When she first smiled at me I knew the love of a father runs deep Someday you might know what I'm going through When a miracle smiles up at you I loved her first",
