It's like that and that's the way it is Bills rise higher every day We receive much lower pay I'd rather stay young, go out and play It's like that, and that's the way it is Huh Wars going on across the sea Street soldiers killing the elderly Whatever happened to unity? It's like that and that's the way it is Disillusion is the word That's used by me when I'm not heard I just go through life with my glasses blurred It's like that, and that's the way it is Huh You can see a lot in this lifespan Like a bum eating out of a garbage can You noticed one time he was your man It's like that What? and that's the way it is You should have gone to school, you could've learned a trade But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid It's like that What? and that's the way it is Huh One thing I know is that life is short So listen up, homeboy, give this a thought The next time someone's teaching, why don't you get taught? It's like that What? and that's the way it is If you really think about it, times aren't that bad The one that flexes with successes will make you glad Stop playing, start praying, you won't be sad It's like that What? and that's the way it is Huh When you feel you fail, sometimes it hurts For a meaning in life is why you search Take the bus or the train, drive to school or the church It's like that and that's the way it is Here's another point in life you should not miss Do not be a fool who's prejudiced Because we're all written down on the same list It's like that What? and that's the way it is Huh You know it's like that and that's the way it is Because it's like that and that's the way it is You know it's like that and that's the way it is Because it's like that and that's the way it is You know it's like that and that's the way it is Because it's like that and that's the way it is You know it's like that and that's the way it is Because it's like that and that's the way it is",

Fresh And his partner, the grand wizard, MC Ricky D D and that's me in the place to be And we gonna show you how we do it for '85, kick it live, alright Because, um, I've got a funny feeling, um You're all sick of all these crap rappers Biting their rhymes because, um, they're back-stabbers But, uh, when it comes to me and my friend Doug Fresh here There is no competition 'cause we are the best, yeah Finesse impress which we prove And y'all will realize that we are on the move So listen close so you all don't miss As we go a little something like this Hit it Ah, yeah Uh, uh, you know what La-di-da-di La-di-da-di La-di La-di You know what, yo, peep this La-di-da-di, we like to party We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody, we're Just some men that's on the mic And when we rock up on the mic we rock the mic Right For all of y'all keeping y'all in health Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself 'Cause it's cool when you cause a cozy condition That we create, 'cause that's our mission So listen to what we say Because this type of shit, it happens every day I woke up around ten o'clock in the morning I gave myself a stretch up, a morning yawning Went to the bathroom to wash up Had some soap on my face and my hand upon a cup I said, Um, mirror, mirror on the wall Who is the top choice of them all? There was a rumble jumble, five minutes it lasted The mirror said, You are, you conceited bastard! But that's true, that's why we never have no beef So then I washed off the soap and brushed the gold teeth Used Oil Of Olay 'cause my skin gets pale And then I got the files for my fingernails Due to the night and on my behalf I put the bubbles in the tub so I could have a bubble bath Clean, dry was my body and hair I threw on my brand new Gucci underwear For all the girls I might take home I got the Johnson's Baby Powder and the Polo cologne Fresh, dress like a million bucks Threw on the Bally shoes and the fly green socks Stepped out my house stopped short, oh no I went back in, I forgot my Kangol And then I dilly dally, I ran though a alley I bumped into my old girl Sally from the valley This is a girl plays hard to get so I said What's wrong? 'cause she looked upset, she said It's all because of you I'm feeling sad and blue You went away and now my life is filled with rainy days And I love you so, how much you'll never know 'Cause you took your love away from me Now what was I to do? She's crying over me and she was feeling blue I said, um, Don't cry, dry your eye Here comes your mother with those two little guys Her mean mother stepped up, said to me Hi Looked Sally in the face and decked her in the eye Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet Slammed the child on the hard concrete The bitch was strong, the kids was gone Something was wrong, I said What is going on? I tried to break it up, I said Stop it, leave her She said If I can't have you, she can't either She grabbed me closely by my socks So I broke the hell out like I had the chicken pox, but She gave chase, she caught up quick She put a finger in the face of MC Rick She said, Why don't you give me a play So we can go cruising in my OJ? And if you give me that OK I'll give you all my love today Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, can't you see? Somehow your words just hypnotize me And I just love your jazzy ways Oh, MC Rick, my love is here to stay! And on and on and on she kept on The bitch been around before my mother's born I said, Cheer up, I gave her a kiss I said, You can't have me, I'm too young for you miss. She says, No, you're not! then she starts crying I says, I'm nineteen, she said, Stop lying! I says, I am, go ask my mother And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover! To the tick tock ya don't stop To the tick tick ya don't quit Hit it! Don't never forget, Doug E. Fresh and The Get Fresh Crew",

The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure I'll do years if I pull this trigger So he cold dashed and ran around the block Cop radios in to another lady cop He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister Shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her Looked 'round good and from expectations So he decided he'd head for the subway stations But she was coming and he made a left He was runnin' top speed 'til he was outta breath Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him Sorry Then he made his move to an abandoned building Ran up the stairs up to the top floor Opened up the door there, guess who he saw? Who? Dave, the dope fiend shootin' dope Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap He said, I need bullets, hurry up, run The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun He went outside but there was cops all over Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova Raced up the block doing eighty-three Crashed into a tree near university Escaped alive though the car was battered Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered Ran out of bullets and he still had static Grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic Pointed at her head, he said the gun was full of lead He told the cops, Back off, or honey here is dead Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong So he let the lady go and he starts to run on Uh-huh Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded And before long the little boy got surrounded He dropped his gun, so went the glory And this is the way I have to end this story He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh Uh-huh Just another case about the wrong path Uh-huh Straight and narrow or your soul gets cast Good night Knock him out the box, Rick Knock him out, Rick - Oh, boy. That Uncle Ricky is really weird - I know, right? What does he mean? Straight and narrow or yo' soul gets cast? - I don't know. I think he be crackin' it up or something - Well, I'm goin' to bed.

Fuck her! You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker This is the autobiography of the E And if you ever fuck with me You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton Compton Compton Compton City of Compton, City of Compton Damn, that shit was dope!",

She said: I was very amused I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange Then when I asked, Do ya have a man?, she tried to pretend She said: No, I don't, I only have a friend Come on! I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing You, you got what I need But you say he's just a friend And you say he's just a friend, oh baby You got what I need But you say he's just a friend But you say he's just a friend, oh baby You got what I need But you say he's just a friend But you say he's just a friend So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime 'Cause I have friends and that's a fact Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack Forget about that, let's go into the story About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me So we started talkin', gettin' familiar Spendin' a lot of time, so we can build a Relationship or some understanding How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin' Everything sounded so dandy and sweet I had no idea I was in for a treat After this was established, everything was cool The tour was over and she went back to school I called every day to see how she was doin' Every time that I called her, it seemed somethin' was brewin' I called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again I say: Yo, who was that? Oh, he's just a friend Don't gimme that, don't even gimme that! Jus' bust this You, you got what I need But you say he's just a friend And you say he's just a friend, oh baby You got what I need But you say he's just a friend But you say he's just a friend, oh baby You got what I need But you say he's just a friend But you say he's just a friend So, I came to her college on a surprise visit To see my girl, that was so exquisite It was a school day, I knew she was there The first semester of the school year I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm This guy made me fill out a visitor's form He told me where it was and I was on my way To see my baby doll, I was happy to say I arrived in front of the dormitory Yo, could you tell me where is door three? They showed me where it was for the moment I didn't know I was in for such an event So, I came to her room and opened the door Oh, snap! Guess what I saw? A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth I was so in shock, my heart went down south So please, listen to the message that I send Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend...",

And runnin' from the police, that's right Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside And even as a crack fiend, Mama You always was a black queen, Mama I finally understand For a woman, it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it There's no way I can pay you back But the plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated Lady, don't you know we love ya? Dear Mama Sweet lady, place no one above ya You are appreciated Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair No love for my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there He passed away and I didn't cry 'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along I was lookin' for a father, he was gone I hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs They showed a young brother love I moved out and started really hangin' I needed money of my own, so I started slangin' I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox I love payin' rent when the rent is due I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you 'Cause when I was low you was there for me You never left me alone, because you cared for me And I could see you comin' home after work late You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate You just workin' with the scraps you was given And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin' But now the road got rough, you're alone You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own And there's no way I can pay you back But my plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated Lady, don't you know we love ya? Dear Mama Sweet lady, place no one above ya You are appreciated Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? Pour out some liquor and I reminisce 'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that I'm hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret, always stayed real And I appreciate how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day Everything will be alright if you hold on It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on And there's no way I can pay you back But my plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated Lady, don't you know we love ya?

First, you better learn how to rhyme I'm the pinnacle; that means I reign supreme And I'm notorious; I'll crush you like a jellybean, I'm bad Suspect was last spotted with three other members of his group DJ Bobcat and E-Love and then Cut Creator They are extremely bad, so keep your eyes open Use extreme caution I eliminate punks, cut 'em up in chunks You were souped, you heard me and your ego shrunk I'm devastating, I'm so good it's a shame 'Cause I eat rappers like a cannibal, they call me insane I'm as strong as a bull, of course you know why I pull I enjoy what I'm doing plus I'm paid in full Not Buckaroo Banzai, but bustin' out as I Say the kind of rhymes that make emcees wish that I'd die Never retire or put my mic on the shelf The baddest rapper in the history of rap itself Not bitter or mad, just provin' I'm bad You want a hit? Give me a hour plus a pen and a pad Emcees retreat 'cause they know I can beat 'em And eat 'em in a battle and the ref won't cheat 'em I'm the baddest, takin' out all rookies So forget Oreos, eat Cool J cookies, I'm bad Cool J, Cool J Bob, Cool J Yo, we get it, Cool J-J-J Cool J-J, J, Cool, Cool J Never ever, no never Never wearin' no Levis, battle me?

But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin' my back I can see him when I'm deep in the covers When I awake I don't see the motherfucker He owns a black hat like I own A black suit and a cane like my own Some might say, Take a chill, B. But fuck that shit, there's a nigga tryna kill me I'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows, every twenty seconds got me peepin' out my window Investigatin' the joint for traps Checkin' my telephone for taps I'm starin' at the woman on the corner It's fucked up when your mind's playin' tricks on ya I make big money, I drive big cars, everybody know me; it's like I'm a movie star But late at night, somethin' ain't right, I feel I'm bein' tailed by the same sucker's headlights Is it that fool that I ran off the block? Or is it that nigga last week that I shot? Or is it the one I beat for 5,000 dollars? Thought he had 'caine, but it was Gold Medal flour Reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers Ain't no use to me lyin', I was scareder than a motherfucker Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick If it's goin' down, let's get this shit over with Here they come, just like I figured, I got my hand on the motherfuckin' trigger What I saw'll make your ass start gigglin', three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens I live by the sword I take my boys everywhere I go because I'm paranoid I keep lookin' over my shoulder and peepin' around corners My mind is playin' tricks on me Day by day it's more impossible to cope I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope Can't keep a steady hand, because I'm nervous Every Sunday morning I'm in service Prayin' for forgiveness And tryin' to find an exit out the business I know the Lord is lookin' at me, but yet and still, it's hard for me to feel happy I often drift when I drive, havin' fatal thoughts of suicide Bang and get it over with And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit I got a little boy to look after, and if I die, then my child'll be a bastard I had a woman down with me But to me it seemed like she was down to get me She helped me out in this shit But to me she was just another bitch Now she's back with her mother Now I'm realizin' that I love her Now I'm feelin' lonely My mind is playin' tricks on me This year, Halloween fell on a weekend, me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treatin' Robbin' little kids for bags, 'til a lawman got behind our ass So we speeded up the pace Took a look back and he was right before our face He'd be in for a squabble, no doubt So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth He was goin' down, we figured, but this wasn't no ordinary nigga He stood about six or seven feet Now that's the nigga I be seein' in my sleep So we triple-teamed on him Droppin' them motherfuckin' B's on him The more I swung, the more blood flew Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too Then I felt just like a fiend, it wasn't even close to Halloween It was dark as fuck on the streets, my hands were all bloody from punchin' on the concrete Goddamn, homie My mind is playin' tricks on me",

One-time tried to come in my home Take my chrome, I said Yo, it's on Take cover son, or you're assed-out How you like my chrome? Then I watched the rookie pass out Didn't have to blast out, but I did anyway... Hahaha... that young punk had to pay So I just killed a man!

Understand where I'm comin' from? When you're up on the hill in your bigger home I'm out here riskin' my dome Just for a bucket, or a fast ducat Just to stay alive, ay yo I gotta say fuck it Here is something you can't understand How I could just kill a man Here is something you can't understand How I could just kill a man Here is something you can't understand How I could just kill a man Here is something you can't understand How I could just kill a man Here is something you can't understand What does it all mean?

Bring in the Sandman, sucker.. because it's over My name is Erick Sermon and I'm back again I see the heads still turnin' and my so-called friends They smile in my face -- behind my back they talk trash Mad and stuff -- because they don't have cash Like the E-Double.. or the PMD He drives a Corvette, I drive a Samurai Suzuki I'm a locksmith.. with the key to fame Never high on myself -- always stay the same Play a lot because I'm hot, like a horse I trot Around the track and back -- fatigued? No, I'm not Well I'm the mellow, the fellow, the one who likes to say hello To a fly girl that is good to go With the slow tempo, and the off-beat rhyme flow Cause when I am in action, there is no time for maxin' Or relaxin' -- just reactin' and subtractin' On a sucker MC who mouth keeps on yappin' and flappin' I lose my cool, then I'll start slappin' and smackin' You wanna roll? Then Albee start jackin' and cappin' No time to lounge, I'm packin' and strappin' At my point of attack I soar at you like an eagle I'm the sheriff, and bitin' is illegal So next time in town, I highly recommend this You gots to chill, because I'm Strictly Business",

Well, Superman looked up at me, he said, You rock so naturally I said now that you've learned the deal, let me tell you why I'm so for real I'm Cozmo D from outer space I came to rock the human race I do it right 'cause I can't do it wrong That's why the whole world is singin' this song Jam on it Jam on it I said jam-j-j-j-jam on it As day turns to night and night turns to day Whatever time it is I wanna hear you say Jam on it Jam on it I said jam-m-m-m-m, jam on it Jam all around and upside down Keep jammin' to the Jam On Production sound Jam on it Jam on it I said jam-j-j-j-jam on it I said Jam On is the funky beat that takes control With the sure shot boogie that'll rock your soul Jam on it Jam on it I said jam-j-j-j-jam on it Get outta your seat and jam to the beat And don't you dare stop till early mornin' Jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it Jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it Yeah, that's how you do it Cozmo You rocked it, that's the way you do it Yeah, like, did you see when he went in the corner And he started doin' this Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki Ah, man, this is too funky for me I'm goin' home Hey, Mergatroid, let's go Hey, you fellas seen my sister Mergatroid?

Fucking blue lights: L.A.P.D Pigs searched our car, their day was made Found an Uzi, forty-four and a hand grenade Threw us in the county high-power block No freaks to see, no beats to rock Didn't want trouble, but the shit must fly Squabbled with this sucker, shanked him in the eye But just living in the County is a serious task Nigga didn't know what happened, didn't have time to ask Word Back on the streets after five and a deuce Seven years later, but still had the juice My homeboy Hen Gee put me up the track Told me E's rolling Villain, BJ's got the sack Bruce is a giant, Nat C's clocking dough Be-Bop's a pimp, my old freak's a ho The batter-rams rolling, rocks are the thing Life has no meaning and money is king Then he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin He said, Man, you out early, we thought you got ten Opened his safe, kicked me down with cold cash Knew I would get busy, he didn't waste time to ask Word I bought a Benz with the money, the rest went on clothes Went to the strip, started pimping the hoes My hair had grew long on my seven year stay And when I got it done, on my shoulders it lay Hard from the joint, but fly to my heart I didn't want trouble, but the shit had to start Out with my crew, some punks got loud Shotgun blasts echoed through the crowd Six punks hit, two punks died All casualities was applied to their side Human lives has to pass just for talking much trash We didn't know who they were, no one had time to ask Word Swat-team leader yelled, Hit the floor Reached in my pocket, pulled my forty-four Dove across the room, peeped out the window Twenty cops jumped behind a Pinto Out the backdoor like some damn track stars Broke down an alley, jumped into a car Suckers didn't even see us, they musta been blind Black wire touched red, the car was mine We hadn't done nothing but some suckers got shot Hit the first turn, goddamn road block Broke through the block and we did it fast Cops woulda shot us on sight, they wouldn'ta took time to ask Word The rollers gave chase at a serious speed One more conviction was all I need This shit was for real, it was no La-Di-Da-Di 'Cause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody And me and my crew, we were known to get ill We carried heat for protection but not to kill We bust a corner doing sixty, one police car spun And all I was thinking was, murder one Bust a move into an alley and did it right And me and my crew, we're gone into the night Broke to my old lady's, who drew me a bath She didn't even know what happened, didn't care, didn't ask Word We made love like crazy on top of the sheets This girlie was my worlie, a natural freak She ran her tongue over each and every part of me Then she rocked my Amadeus while I watched TV A technician with a mission, that's what she was If there had been a crowd she would've got an applause This girl did everything on Earth to me that could be done Then she backed off and teased me so I couldn't cum Then she cold got stupid, pushed me on the floor Had me begging to stop while I was screaming for more After she waxed my body, she let me crash She knew her loving was def, she didn't waste time to ask Word Up the next morning, feeling good as hell Sleeping with a girlie sure beats a cell Hit the boulevard in my AMG Ho's catching whiplash, trying to glimpse the T Ring on my mobile, yes, cellular Got to have a phone when I'm in my car Was my homeboy Red, some say he's insane Broke his bitch jaw for smoking 'caine Told me to meet him at the airport Said he's jumping bail, said he just left court Caught the first thing smoking in a serious dash Didn't know where we was going, didn't care, didn't ask Word Fell asleep on the plane and so did he, woke up chilling in N.Y.C Called up my posse when I got there Hit the Latin Quarter and Union Square Rooftop devil's nest, the rest we passed Back-door'd the Palladium just for class About 4 a.m. we crashed the deuce We never catch static 'cause my boys got juice Deuced it to the Bronx to rest our heads Where a shoot-out jumped off, nine people lay dead It sounded like it happened with a Mac-10 blast But it was 6 in the morning, we didn't wake up to ask Word",

This shirt cost twenty dollars I said, Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar The next half hour was the same old thing My mother buyin' me clothes from 1963 And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips I said, Mom, what are you doin'? You're ruining my rep She said, You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet I said, Mom, let's put these clothes back, please? She said No, you go to school to learn, not for a fashion show I said, This isn't Sha-Na-Na, come on mom, I'm not Bowzer Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers But if you don't want to, I can live with that, but You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks She wasn't with it, everything stayed the same Inevitably, the first day of school came I thought I could get over her, I tried to play sick But my mom said, No, no way, uh-uh, forget it There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought The kids were crackin' up laughing at the clothes Mom bought And those who weren't laughin' still had a ball 'Cause they were pointing and whispering as I walked down the hall I got home and told my mom how my day went She said, If they were laughing, you don't need 'em 'Cause they're not good friends: For the next six hours, I tried to explain to my mom That I was gonna have to go through this about two-hundred more times So, to you all the kids all across the land There's no need to argue. parents just don't understand Okay, here's the situation My parents went away on a week's vacation And they left the keys to the brand new Porsche Would they mind? Um, well, of course not I'll just take it for a little spin And maybe show it off to a couple of friends I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood Well, maybe I shouldn't Yeah, of course, I should Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block That's when I saw this beautiful girlie-girl walkin' I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talkin' You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions I honked my horn just to get her attention She said, Was that for me? I said, Yeah, she said, Why? I said, Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy She said, How do I know you're not sick? You could be some deranged lunatic I said, C'mon, toots, my name is the Prince Besides, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this? She agreed and we were on our way She was lookin' very good and so was I, I must say, word We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries, with Cokes She kicked her shoes off onto the floor She said, Drive fast, speed turns me on She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast The sunroof was open, the music was high And this girl's hand was steadily movin' up my thigh She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car We're doin' ninety in my Mom's new Porsche And to make this long story short, short When the cop pulled me over, I was scared as hell I said, I don't have a license, but I drive very well, officer Almost had a heart attack that day Come to find out the girl was a twelve year-old runaway I was arrested, the car was impounded There was no way for me to avoid bein' grounded My parents had to come off from vacation to get me I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me My parents walked in, I got my grip I said, Uh, mom, dad, how was your trip? They didn't speak, I said, I wanna plead my case But my father just shoved me in the car by my face That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived They took turns, one would beat me while the other was drivin' I can't believe it, I just made a mistake Well, parents are the same no matter time nor place So, to you other kids all across the land Take it from me, parents just don't understand",

If your woman steps out with another man That's the breaks, that's the breaks! And she runs off with him to Japan That's the breaks, that's the breaks! And the IRS says they want to chat That's the breaks, that's the breaks! And you can't explain why you claimed your cat That's the breaks, that's the breaks! And Ma Bell sends you a whopping bill That's the breaks, that's the breaks! With 18 phone calls to Brazil That's the breaks, that's the breaks! And you borrowed money from the mob That's the breaks, that's the breaks! And yesterday you lost your job That's the breaks, that's the breaks! Well, these are the breaks Break it up, break it up, break it up Throw your hands up in the sky And wave 'em round from side to side And if you deserve a break tonight Somebody say alright! All right Say ho-oo! Ho-oo! You don't stop Keep on, somebody scream! Owwwww! Break down! Breaks on a stage, breaks on a screen Breaks to make your wallet lean Breaks run cold and breaks run hot Some folks got 'em and some have not But these are the breaks Break it up, break it up, break it up Break down! To the girl in brown, stop messing around Break it up, break it up! To the guy in blue, whatcha gonna do? Break it up, break it up! And to the girl in green, don't be so mean Break it up, break it up! And the guy in red, say what I said Break it up, break it up! Break down! Brakes on a plane, brakes on a train Breaks to make you go insane Breaks in love, breaks in war But we got the breaks to get you on the floor And these are the breaks Break it up, break it up, break it up Break down! Yo! Just do it, just do it, just do it, do it, do it! Just do it, just do it, just do it, do it, do it! Just do it, just do it, just do it, do it, do it! Just do it, just do it, just do it, do it, do it! You say last week you met the perfect guy That's the breaks, that's the breaks! And he promised you the stars in the sky That's the breaks, that's the breaks! He said his Cadillac was gold That's the breaks, that's the breaks! But he didn't say it was 10 years old That's the breaks, that's the breaks! He took you out to the Red Coach grill That's the breaks, that's the breaks! But he forgot the cash and you paid the bill That's the breaks, that's the breaks! And he told you the story of his life That's the breaks, that's the breaks! But he forgot the part about... his wife! Huh! Huh! That's the breaks, that's the breaks! Well, these are the breaks! Break it up, break it up, break it up! Break down!",

But soon you start to suffer, the tune'll get rougher When you start to stutter, that's when you had enough of Biting it'll make you choke, you can't provoke You can't cope, you should've broke because I ain't no joke I got a question as serious as cancer Who can keep the average dancer Hyper as a heart attack? Nobody smiling 'Cause you're expressing the rhyme that I'm styling This is what we all sit down to write You can't make it, so you take it home, break it and bite Use pieces and bits of all my hip-hop hits Get the style down pat, then it's time to switch Put my tape on pause and add some more to yours Then you figure you're ready for the neighborhood tours The E-M-C-E-E, don't even try to be When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me You like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate Then change the rhyme around, that can aggravate me So when you see me come up, freeze Or you'll be one of those seven emcees They think that I'm a new jack but only if they knew that They who think wrong are they who can't do that Style that I'm doing, they might ruin Patterns of paragraphs based on you and Your off-beat DJ, if anything he play sound familiar I'll wait 'til E say, Play 'em So I'ma have to diss and broke You could get a smack for this, I ain't no joke I hold the microphone like a grudge B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge I hold a conversation 'cause what I invent I nominated my DJ for president When I emcee, I'll keep a freestyle going steadily So pucker up and whistle my melody But whatever you do, don't miss one There'll be another rough rhyme after this one Before you know it, you're following and fiending Waiting for the punchline to get the meaning Like before the moral of my story I'm telling Nobody beats the R, so stop yelling Save it, put it in your pocket for later 'Cause I'm moving the crowd, and B'll wreck the fader No interruptions, and the mic is broke When I'm gone, then you can joke 'Cause everything is real, on a serious tip Keep playing and I get furious quick And I'll take you for a walk through hell Freeze your dome, then watch your eyeballs swell Guide you out of triple-stage darkness When it get dark again, then I'ma spark this microphone 'Cause the heat is on, you see smoke And I'm finished when the beat is gone, I'm no joke",

By the way, sweetheart, what's your name? She said: My friends like to call me Exotic Elaine I said: My name is the Prince and she said: Why? I said: Well, I don't know, I'm just a hell of a guy! But enough about me, yo, let's talk about you And all the wonderful things that you and I can do I popped some trash and in a little bit of time I showed some cash and the girl was mine I took her over town, I wined her and dined her She asked me 'did I like her?' I said: Well... kinda All of a sudden, she jumped out her seat Snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street She started grabbin all over me, kissin' and huggin' So I shoved her away, I said: You better stop buggin'! She got mad, looked me dead in my face Threw her hands in the air and yelled out: Rape! I got scared when she started to yell So I handed her my wallet and ran like hell I was duckin' through alleys right and left But when the cops caught up, they almost beat me to death I was arrested, charged with aggravated assault Hey, yo Clancy, we got him! But it wasn't my fault! Nevertheless, don't mean to bust your bubble But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble So next time a girl gives you the play Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away I was in a bar one Friday night Coolin', watchin' a Mike Tyson fight I was maxin' and relaxin', sippin' on tequila When this girl walked up, she said: Hi, my name is Sheila I responded by saying hello She paid for my drink and then said: Let's go 20 minutes later, things were starting to cook As we pulled up into her house, I said: I'm with you, toots The music was soft and there was wine in the glasses She started winking and making little passes At me, she grabbed me close and that's when she got bold She started feeling up my back, I said: Oh, your hands are cold! We went into her bedroom thinking of one thing Took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring I carresed her body and I kissed her cheek And that's when I observed those satin bed sheets I felt that it was time for me to make my move I thought I better hurry up before I busted the groove I leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue A door slammed and a voice said: Baby, where are you? Her boyfriend busted in, he grinned an evil grin And said: Boy, I'mma tear your butt limb from limb! I was scared as hell, where was I supposed to go? I just yelled: Geronimo! and jumped out the window Just my luck we were in a snow storm And all I had was my underwear on to keep me warm And to top the night off, I had to break in my place Because my keys were in my pants back on Sheila's book case I was done, sneezin' and coughin'... Aaa-choo! I hope this doesn't happen too often, but Nevertheless, don't mean to bust your bubble But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble So next time a girl gives you the play Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away I got a ring on my phone, May 5th last year It was my girlfriend Betty, I said: Hello dear! I was just about to call you I got a couple tickets to the Run-D.M.C. concert I'm wit' it It's six o'clock now, at eight will you be ready? Yeah Aight, fine, see you then, Betty I combed my hair, washed, and brushed my teeth Got funky fresh dressed in my Le Coq Sportif Got to Betty's at eight, I was ready to jet Until Betty's mom said: Betty's not ready yet! I sat there for at least an hour It was ten after nine before she got in the shower 9:35, she comes downstairs And said: I need a little longer to finish my hair At ten o'clock, we had been missed the show She comes downstairs and says 'let's go'!? Go where? Go to sleep, I'm gone! I was steamin' like a demon as I drove home But it just goes to show not trying to bust your bubble But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble So next time a girl gives you the play Just remember my rhyme Just remember my rhymes Take heed to my rhymes and get the hell away!",

You're killin' me with your jealousy Now my ambition's to be free I can't breathe, 'cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucker for love What you won't do, do for love?

You said if I'd write you, you would write back See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on 'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7 But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose Sincerely yours, Stan, PS: We should be together too My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I Got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window Window And I can't see at all And even if I could, it'd all be grey But your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad Bad Dear Mr. I'm Too Good to Call or Write My Fans This'll be the last package I ever send your ass It's been six months, and still no word, I don't deserve it? I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' ninety on the freeway Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive? You know the song by Phil Collins, In the Air of the Night About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin' But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him? That's kinda how this is: You coulda rescued me from drownin' Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together, think about it You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it I hope your conscience eats at you, and you can't breathe without me See, Slim, shut up, bitch! I'm tryna talk Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see? I ain't like you 'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now Oh, shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out? My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I Got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window Window And I can't see at all And even if I could, it'd all be grey But your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad Bad Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she? Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on a Starter cap I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too? I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you? You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin' To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some And what's this shit about us meant to be together? That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other I really think you and your girlfriend need each other Or maybe you just need to treat her better I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but, Stan Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan I just don't want you to do some crazy shit I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid And in the car, they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to Come to think about it, his name was, it was you Damn",

My name's Big L Don't ask me how I'm living, 'cause, yo, I'm living swell But then again, I'm living kind of foul 'Cause my girl don't know that I'm out on the prowl To make a long story short, I got the digits Called her on my car phone and paid her a visit I was spankin' her and thankin' her, chewin' her and doin' her Laughin' 'cause my girl didn't know that I was screwin' her Laying like a king on sheets of satin That's what time it is, you know what's happenin' She had a big ole booty, I was doing my duty I mean, yo, I admit that my girl's a cutie But Tina was exotic, Earl's my witness With the kind of legs that put stockings out of business When I went home, I kissed my girl on the cheek But in the back of my mind, it was this big-butt freak I sat my girl down, I couldn't hold it in And said to her with a devilish grin Tina got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true But Tina got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you Tina got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true But Tina got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you I went to the high school about three o'clock To try to catch a cutie riding my jock My homeboy's Jeep, the system blasting Cold forty Dogs, smiling and laughing Girls all over, the kind I adore I felt like a kid in a candy store That's when I seen her, her name was Brenda She had the kind of booty that I'd always remember I said to my man, Stop the Jeep She's only seventeen, but, yo, don't sleep I kicked the bass like an NFL punter And scoped the booty like a big game hunter I said to the girl, Yo, you look tired Let's go get some rest, relax by the fire I put the big booty on a bearskin rug She gave me a kiss, I gave her a hug I said to the girl, Them young boys ain't nothing You wanna get freaky? Let me kiss your belly button I circled it and teased it and made her squeal Grabbed a pack of bullets and pulled out the steel When I was through, I wiped the sweat from my eyes Went to the kitchen and got some sweet potato pies Tina busted in my house while I was eating You know what I said? Too bad you caught me cheating, but— Brenda got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true But Brenda got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you Brenda got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true But Brenda got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you I went to Red Lobster for shrimp and steak Around the time when the waitresses are on their lunch break I pulled in the parking lot, parked my car Somebody shouted out, I don't care who you are I paid it no attention, I walked inside 'Cause Brian had a nine and he was chilling in the ride I walked in the place, everybody was lookin' And shrimp and steak wasn't the only thing cookin' I sat down to eat, ordered my food I said to the waitress, I don't mean to be rude But I'll take you on a platter She said, You got a girl? I said, It don't matter You look like you're tastier than piping hot pizza What's your name? She said, My tag says Lisa I said, Okay, you're smart and all that But when you get off work, yo, I'll be back She looked at me and said, Make yourself clear L, where we going? I said, Right here She looked kind of puzzled, I said, You'll see I pulled up at ten on the D-O-T When she walked out the door, I threw my tongue down her throat Pushed her back inside and pulled off her coat Laid her on the table and placed my order And gave her a tip much bigger than a quarter On and on 'til the break of dawn All over the restaurant, word is bond I heard somebody coughin', I checked my watch I couldn't believe it said nine o'clock I grabbed my pants, put on my Kangol Who did I see? Oh, yo It was Brenda Yo, she worked at Red Lobster, but I didn't remember Lisa got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true But Lisa got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you See ya Lisa got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true But Lisa got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you See ya",

Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me The projects is full of bullets though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me Constantly movin' while makin' millions Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin' Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin' Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted? Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket, the aftermath More bodies bein' buried I'm losin' my homies in a hurry, they're relocatin' to the cemetery Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger Don't wanna make excuses 'cause this is how it is, what's the use? Unless we're shootin', no one notices the youth It's just me against the world, baby Me against the world It's just me against the world It's just me against the world Me against the world 'Cause it's just me against the world, baby Hey Me against the world Ooh yeah I got nothin' to lose It's just me against the world, baby I got nothin' to lose Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself, see Ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin' Seein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons already crazy and screamin' I guess them nightmares as a child Had me scared but left me prepared for a while Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw? Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall Everyday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less, I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin' Cheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin' 'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up My nuts is backed up, I'm about to act up Go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin' And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin' So what? Go put some work in and make my mail Makin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well Me against the world With nothin' to lose Ooh yeah It's just me against the world It's just me against the world, baby Me against the world I got nothin' to lose It's just me against the world It's just me against the world, baby With nothin' to lose It's just me against the world, baby Me against the world Me against the world I got nothin' to lose It's just me against the world, baby hehe With all this extra stressin', the question I wonder is after death, after my last breath When will I finally get to rest through this oppression? They punish the people that's askin' questions And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions Be grateful for blessings, don't ever change, keep your essence The power is in the people and politics we address Always do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic And when you get stranded and things don't go the way you planned it Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world Me against the world Nothin' to lose It's just me against the world, baby Me against the world Got me stuck in the game Ooh yeah It's just me against the world Nothin' to lose It's just me against the world, baby Me against the world Hahaha, that's right I know it seem hard sometimes But, uh, remember one thing Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that So no matter how hard it get Stick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it Me against the world Me against the world Me against the world",

Or stay awake and watch the show I tape Because right now, I'm 'bout to shake and bake The E-R-I-C-K is my name I spell Thanks to the clientele, yo, I rock well I'm not an MC who talkin' all that junk About who can beat who, soundin' like a punk I just get down and I go for mine I say Check one-two, and run down the line To the average MC, I'm known as The Terminator Funky beat maker, new jack exterminator Destroyin' a ploy when your rhymes are now void Never sweatin' your girl, Why P? 'cause she's a skeezoid When I'm on the scene, I always rock the spot I grab the steel with the crown on top In the beginnin', I like to let my rhymes flow And at twelve, I press cruise control Sit back and relax, let my rhymes tax Maintain MCs while the Double-E macks Always calm under pressure, no need to act ill Listen when I tell you, boy... you gots to chill! You gots to chill! DJ K La Boss cuts Jungle Boogie I be the personal computer, information on rap Like the B-I-Z Markie says, I'll make your toes tap I format the rhymes, step by step Make 'em sound def to maintain my rep Prepared to come off in case of a diss Not worried about a thing, 'cause we can do this I can turn the party out just by standin' still Make the ladies scream and shout while the brothers act ill Take total control of your body and soul Pack a 9 in my pants for when it's time to roll I'm the P-double-E-M-D-E-E And one thing I hate is a bitin' MC When I enter the party, suckas always form a line Then they ease their way up and try to bite my lines I did thousands of shows, dissed many faces And deal with new jacks on a one-to-one basis But every now and then, a sucka MC gets courageous And like an epidemic, it becomes contagious But never the least, they all R.I.P For all those unaware — it means Rest In Peace 'Cause M.D. stands for Microphone Doctor And the capital P Capital P, capital M Capital M Capital D-E-E's no doubt the chief rocker Don't like to get ill, but if I have to, I kill So believe me, boy... you gots to chill! You gots to chill! DJ K La Boss cuts Jungle Boogie Catch every word I'm sayin' — no, there's no delayin' Don't hesitate to motivate the crowd, I'm not playin' Seein' is believin', you catch my drift? Don't try to adapt because I'm just too swift How swift? I'm so swift, and that's an actual fact I'm like Zorro, I mark a E in your back I don't swing on no ropes or no iron cords The only weapon is my rappin' sword Intimidate MC's with the tone of my vocal throne When I'm pushin' on the microphone 'Cause I'm the funky rhyme maker, MC undertaker The one who likes to max and relax And when it's time, issue dig-em-smacks I keep their hands clappin', fingers snappin', feet tappin' When it's time to roll, Uzi patrol is packin' PMD — the mic's my only friend And through the course of the party, I kill again and again So if you're thinkin' 'bout battlin', you better come prepared Come with your shield and your armor geared You gots to chill!

What type of facts are those? If you grew up with holes in your zapatos You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough I'm like, Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole! If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward Got beef with radio if I don't play they show They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so Rap mags try and use my black ass So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me! Ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me! The year is '94, in my trunk is raw In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case So I pull over to the side of the road I heard, Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for? 'Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low? Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know Am I under arrest or should I guess some more? Well, you was doing fifty-five in a fifty-four License and registration and step out of the car Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit? Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that Aren't you sharp as a tack? You some type of lawyer or something? Somebody important or something? Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit Enough that you won't illegally search my shit Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come! I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

Ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one Now once upon a time not too long ago A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform You know the type, loud as a motorbike But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin' And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again Back through the system with the riff-raff again Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' 'em D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again Half a mil' for bail 'cause I'm African All because this fool was harassin' them Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun I got ninety-nine problems, bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me!

How ya like me now? How ya like me now? Now brothers are riding me like a pony I'm no phony, I'm the only real mic-aroni Playin' the mic like it's supposed to be played New jacks, you all shoulda stayed Out of the business, what is this Amateur night at the Apollo? Get off this stage, I'm in a rage Just like a lion trapped inside of a cage I'm the real king, rap is a jungle I never understood, how could one go To a party, watch me, stand around and jock me Become a rapper, then try to rock me Schemin' like a demon, you're screamin' and dreamin' I'm from the old school, I used to see men Die for less, but I'm not living that way I'll let my mic do the talkin' And let the music play How ya like me now? Rap is an art and I'm like Picasso But of course, why else would you try so Hard to paint a picture, and try to get ya Self in my shoes, but they won't fit ya I'm bigger and better, forget about deffer Every time I rocked the mic, I left a Stain in your brain that will remain Stuck in the back of your brain till you see me Again, respect, I come correct The rhymes I select are nothing short of perfect Vernacular's pure and I can ensure Life or death with my breath, my voice is a cure I heal life from the words I spread I'll make a sick man rock on his death bed Sucker MC's, I'll make your girl say, Ow And she's jockin', now how ya like me now? How ya like me now? How ya like me now? It irked my nerve when I heard A sucker rapper that I know I'll serve Run around town sayin' he is the best Is that a test? I'm not impressed Get real, you're nothing but a toy Don't ya know that I'll serve that boy? Just like a waiter, hit 'em with a plate of These fresh rhymes and Make sure that he pay the bill And leave him standin' still When he's had enough, hit him with a refill And for dessert it won't be no ice cream I'm just gonna shatter and splatter his pipe dreams Make him feel the wrath, beat him down, and laugh And when I finish, then I'm gonna ask him Who is the best? And if he don't say, Moe Dee I'll take my whip and make him call himself Toby Whip him good, then I'll make him sweat Always talkin' about battles and never had a battle yet But if we ever did, how could you beat me? You're so petrified, you're scared to even meet me My word's the law, that's why you don't beef You're nothing but a punk, track star, and a thief So I'm puttin' you on punishment, just like a child Never touch another mic, how ya like me now? How ya like me now? I could continue, there's more on the menu But I'll relax 'cause I'm so far in you You had enough, I know you're overstuffed And if I keep going, you'll be throwin' up Old rhymes I used to say way back in the day When you used to come to my parties and pay Nobody's ever gonna rock me and this I vow So all I wanna say is how ya like me now? How ya like me now? How ya like me now? How ya like me now?",

All the way live, I think I was about 10 One of those happy little niggas singing the blues That be always trying to bag with the shag and karate shoes Sayin' Yo momma black, his momma this, his momma that Then he get mad and wanna scrap We stay mad about–10 minutes, then it's like–back on the bike To play hide-and-go-get-it with the younger hoes by the bungalows Then switch to playing Ding Dong Ditch, when that gets Old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket You could tell the ballers 'cause they bell wearing Gazelles And if they really had money, rays be sporting BK's And, all the girls had they Turkish link If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it But, sometimes, I still sit and reminisce, then Think about the years I was raised, back in the days Back in the days, when I was young I'm not a kid anymore But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again Back in the days, when I was young I'm not a kid anymore But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again Back in the days, when I was young I'm not a kid anymore But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again Back in the days, when I was young I'm not a kid anymore But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again And everybody say I remember way back when And everybody say I remember way back when And everybody say I remember way back when What?

Friends Ones we can depend on Friends ‎ How many of us have them? Friends ‎ Before we go any further, let's be Friends You say you and your girlfriend were so tight You took her out with you and your guy one night She even had a set of keys to your home And you shared mostly everything you owned But as she shook your hand, she stole your man And it was done so sweet, it had to be a plan Couldn't trust her with cheese, let alone your keys With friends like that, you don't need enemies You wonder how long it was all going on And you're still not sure if you're glad he's gone You say, well, if she took him, he was never mine But deep inside, you know that's just another lie And now you're kinda cold toward people you meet 'Cause of something that was done to you by some creep But nevertheless, I'll say it again That these are the people that we call friends Friends ‎ How many of us have them? Friends ‎ Before we go any further, let's be Friends Friends ‎ How many of us have them? Friends Ones we can depend on Friends ‎ How many of us have them?

To the kid, to the kid! I'm telling her every lie that you know that I never did Hey ladies! Get funky! All the ladies in the house! Yeah The ladies, the ladies Well – me in a corner with a good-lookin' daughter I dropped my drawers, said [Welcome back, Kotter] We was cuttin' up the rug She started cuttin' up the carpet In my apartment I begged her Please stop it! Well – the gift of gab is the gift that I have And that girl ain't nothin' but a crab! Educated? No! Stupid? Yep And when I say stupid, I mean stupid [Fresh!] I'm not 'James At 15', or Chachi 'In Charge' I'm Adam and I'm adamant about livin' large! With the white Sassoons and then the looks that kill Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville I met a little cutie, she was all hopped up on zootie I liked the little cutie, but I kicked her in the booty 'Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around You be listenin' to my records – a number one sound Just step to the rhythm, step, step! to the ride! I've got an open mind, so why don't you all get inside?! Tune in, turn on, to my tune that's live! Ladies flock, like bees to a hive Hey ladies! Get funky! Hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies! Hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies! One more time Ain't it funky now? Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies! Ain't It Funky Now? Well, you–know–that–– She's got a gold tooth, you know she's hardcore She'll show you a good time, then she'll show you the door Break up with your girl! It ended in tears! Vincent Van Gogh, go and mail that ear! I call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinkin' The phone booth on the corner is damp and it's stinkin'! She said Come on over, it was me that she missed I threw that trash can through her window 'cause–'cause you know I got dissed! Your old lady left you, and you went insane! You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 Train Well, take my advice, at any price A gorilla like your mother is mighty weak, man Suckin' down pints until I didn't know Woke up in the morning with a Won Ton Ho 'Cause I announce I like girls that bounce! With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce Girls with curls, and big long locks And beatnik chicks, just wearing their smocks Walkin' high and mighty, like she's number one Hey ladies! Get funky! What's that? Dance! Hey Hey Hey Hey la-- Hey, ladies!",

I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell Love yourself, girl, or nobody will Though you a woman I don't know how you deal With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you You wake up, put makeup on Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can't face what's wrong No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on Your roommate yelling, Why you gotta take so long?!

But one more time for the 'Ville And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let's make a mil' Hey officer man, we don't want nobody gettin' killed Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail I got money for the bail now, and well now If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah I ain't snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now If you was around then you wouldn't need a witness now How you like this crooked smile?

Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?

Uh, bye... She keeps on passin' me by! But nevertheless, I'll say it again She keeps on passin' me by! Yes she does... But nevertheless, I'll say it again that– She keeps on pass— When I dream of fairy tales, I think of me and Shelly See, she's my type of hype, and I can't stand when brothers tell me That I should quit chasin' and look for something better But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her I just play love by the ear and hope she gets the picture I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger She could be my broad, and I could be her— And I could be her... All I could do was stare Back as kids, we used to kiss when we played Truth Or Dare Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer To get in her book, and it looks rather dry I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try and stop the stride 'Cause I won't have no more of this passin' me by Time for me to voice my opinion, can't be pretending she didn't have me Sprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan Damn, she looked good, downside, she had a man He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop She told me Soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand By letting her pass, I'd prove to be a better man She keeps on passin' me by! Passin' me by... She keeps on passin' me by! But nevertheless, I'll say it again She keeps on passin' me by! But nevertheless, I'll say it again Passin' me by-aye-aye... She keeps on passin' me— Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when– Ever she happens to walk by, why does the apple of my eye Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try? Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence From a distance, I desired her, secretly admired her Wired her a letter, to get her, and it went: My dear, my dear, my dear You do not know me, but I know you very well Now let me tell you 'bout the feelings I feel for you When I try or make some sort of attempt, I simp Damn, I wish I wasn't such a wimp 'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so And if I was your man, then I would be true The only lying I would do is in the bed with you Then I signed: Sincerely The one who loves you dearly P.S. Love Me Tender But the letter came back three days later: Return to Sender Damn... She keeps on passin' me by! She keeps on passin' me by! But nevertheless, I'll say it again She keeps on passin' me by! But nevertheless, I'll say it again that– She keeps on passin' me by!

The man with the plan and the man demands you Leave the smack and the crack for the wack Throw the vial in the Nile; keep a smile like that Leave the knife and the gun in the store And ignore temptation, sent by the nation Racial gain causes pain; need a new rep In your hearts and minds never forget Yusef Hawkins, and when you're walking, you don't just run Black on black; remember that; it's important Anyway the struggle is won, brings forth the fun No hatred; the summer's almost done No time for sleep, jump in your Jeep And pump up the funky beat a whole week Beeper goes off, yo, smash it and trash it You're too young to be plumped in a casket Just get your boys and bring the noise And just swing it, and party people, sing it Treat me right, I'll treat you good Kids in the crib want dibs on the big man Can he come out? Can he come out and slam a jam? I'm his number one fan, yes I am All these kids realize that I'm the man Six foot three and maybe a quarter of an inch bigger Than last year, but still a unique figure Rob Swinger, Doc No, Dinky, and Hot Dog know That I'm a man who was born to have a mic on Next to me at all times, ready to kick a rhyme That will keep me out of financial bind That's why when it comes to fans, I'm never mean Kids on St. James between Gates and Greene Always says hello, cause I'm a modest fellow Never try to play a superstar, that's hollow Cause if these kids don't go buy our records We'll be has-beens, and plus naked So we owe them, so pull out your pen Sign an autograph, you might make a new friend So just get your boys and bring the noise and just swing it And party people in the house, sing it Party people in the house, listen up I'm the man with the plan and the band rips it up Peace to Howie Tee, good lookin', gee Swinger, Hot Dog, Doc No, Bud, Ed Lover, Dinky Fish and chips with the hippy hippy hips Before the tune ends, give me some lips ah!

I'm outspoken, my language is broken into a slang But it's just a dialect that I select when I hang I play it cool, 'cause cooling is all that I'm about Just fooling with the girlies, yes I'm busting it out I'm Special Ed and you can tell by the style that I use I'm creatively superior, yo, I never lose I never lost 'cause I'm the boss, I never will 'cause I'm still The champion, chief one, won't lose until I choose Which I won't 'cause I don't retreat I'll run you over like a truck and leave you dead in the street You're inviting me, a titan to a battle Why? I don't need your respect 'cause I got it made... I'm talented, yes I'm gifted Never boosted, never shoplifted I got the cash, but money ain't nothin' Make a million dollars every record that I cut and My name is Special Ed and I'm a super-duper star Every other month I get a brand new car Got twenty, that's plenty yet I still want more Kind of fond of Honda scooters, got 74 I got the riches to fulfill my needs Got land in the sand of the West Indies Even got a little island of my very own I got a frog, a dog with a solid gold bone An accountant to account the amount I spent Got a treaty with Tahiti 'cause I own a percent Got gear I wear for everyday Boutiques from France to the U.S.A And I make all the money from the rhymes I invent So it really doesn't matter, how much I spent Because yo, I make fresh rhymes daily You burn me, really?? Think, just blink and I've made a million rhymes Just imagine if you blinked a million times Damn I'd be paid I got it made... I'm kind of spoiled 'cause everything I want I got made I wanted gear, got everything from cotton to suede I wanted leg, I didn't beg I just got laid My hair was growing too long, so I got me a fade And when my dishes got dirty, I got Cascade And when the weather was hot, I got a spot in the shade I'm wise because I rise to the top of my grade Wanted peace on Earth, so to God I prayed Some kids across town thought I was afraid They couldn't harm me, I got the army brigade I'm not a trader, if what you got is greater I'll trade But maybe later 'cause my waiter made potatoed alligator soufflé I got it made...",

Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be So, what you sayin'? It's like the game ain't the same Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us .45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin' It drops deep as it does in my breath I never sleep, huh, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind New York state of mind New York state of mind New York state of mind New York state of mind Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TECs Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped Investments in stock, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin' Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin' Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha, and shelter Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back, black I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain And be prosperous, though we live dangerous Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages It's only right that I was born to use mics And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule The smooth criminal on beat breaks Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya Inhale deep like the words of my breath I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind New York state of mind New York state of mind New York state of mind New York state of mind Nasty Nas—",

I almost blinded her She said, Great Scott! Are you a thief? Seems like you have a mouth full of gold teeth Ha-ha, hah!

He grabbed me by my shirt and pulled me right out the store He said, I don't want to see you playing with these lowlifes no more! Now come along, we have a party to attend With some real mature women and some more of our friends He hailed down a cab and he waited for a minute And as the cab came, he thrusted me in it! And as we were leaving and driving along I could hear a melody as Mona sang a song If you see me walking down the street And I start to cry each time we meet Walk on by, walk on by, foolish pride That's all that I have left, so, let me hide The pain and the hurt that you gave me When you said goodbye You walked on by",

Get in, nigga I'll take you to the pad soon Went to mom's house and dropped a load in the bathroom Jumped back in my lowrider Comin' out feelin' about ten pounds lighter Went to Bone's house so I can get the gat Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at Lench Mob ain't nothin' but tramps For hoes lickin' nuts like stamps One fool bumpin' music for the yamps But Ice Cube had more amps, get in, bitch 'Cause I had the jam on And I don't want to hear shit about a tampon Gimme the nappy and make me happy The ho said, Pappy, could you slap me On the ass hard and fast And could please try not to leave a gash? I said, Yeah, but I don't play sex Without puttin' on the latex Slipped on the condom Fucked around and dropped the bomb, son And it came out sort of like confetti In for the night, no longer steady mobbin' Have you ever seen such a sight in your life? Steady mobbin' Have you ever seen such a sight in your life? There goes the neighborhood Have you ever seen such a sight in your life? Steady mobbin' Have you ever seen such a sight in your life? There goes the neighborhood There goes the neighborhood Get the radio, get the radio There goes the neighborhood",
