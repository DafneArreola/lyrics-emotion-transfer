Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare? Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there? Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again? Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight? I wonder if you are lonesome tonight You know someone said that the world's a stage, and each must play a part Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart Act one was where we met I loved you at first glance You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue Then came act two You seemed to change, you acted strange And why I've never known Honey, you lied when you said you loved me And I had no cause to doubt you But I'd rather go on hearing your lies Than to go on living without you Now the stage is bare, and I'm standing there With emptiness all around And if you won't come back to me Then they can bring the curtain down Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again? Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?",

I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge Mama said to me, Child, what's happened to your appetite? I've been cookin' all mornin', and you haven't touched a single bite That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge And she and Billie Joe was throwin' somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe And brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo There was a virus goin' 'round; Papa caught it, and he died last spring And now Mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",

Another day older and deeper in debt Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go I owe my soul to the company store I was born one morning, it was drizzlin' rain Fightin' and trouble are my middle name I was raised in the canebrake by an old mama lion Can't no high-toned woman make me walk the line You load sixteen tons, what do you get?

I truly am indeed Alone again, naturally It seems to me that there are more hearts broken in the world That can't be mended Left unattended What do we do? What do we do? Alone again, naturally Now looking back over the years And what ever else that appears I remember I cried When my father died Never wishing to hide the tears And at sixty-five years old My mother, God rest her soul Couldn't understand Why the only man She had ever loved had been taken Leaving her to start With a heart so badly broken Despite encouragement from me No words were ever spoken And when she passed away I cried and cried all day Alone again, naturally Alone again, naturally",

And do you have faith in God above If the Bible tells you so? Now, do you believe in rock 'n' roll? Can music save your mortal soul? And can you teach me how to dance real slow? Well, I know that you're in love with him 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died I started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin', This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die Now, for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone But that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh, and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned No verdict was returned And while Lenin read a book on Marx The quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died We were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin', This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and fallin' fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now, the halftime air was sweet perfume While sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance 'Cause the players tried to take the field The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died? We started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin', This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die Oh, and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So, come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend Oh, and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in Hell Could break that Satan spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died He was singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin', This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn't play And in the streets, the children screamed The lovers cried and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died And there I stood alone and afraid I dropped to my knees and there I prayed And I promised Him everything I could give If only He would make the music live And He promised it would live once more But this time one would equal four And in five years four had come to mourn And the music was reborn And they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin', This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die They were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin', This'll be the day that I die",

Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her And then you get distracted by her older sister When in walks her father and takes you in line And says, Better go home, son, and make up your mind Then you bet you'd better finally decide And say yes to one and let the other one ride There's so many changes and tears you must hide Did you ever have to finally decide?",

But she smiled at me so sadly That my anger straightway died And so it was that later As the miller told his tale That her face at first just ghostly Turned a whiter shade of pale If music be the food of love Then laughter is its queen And likewise if behind is in front Then dirt in truth is clean My mouth by then like cardboard Seemed to slip straight through my head So we crash-dived straightway quickly And attacked the ocean bed And so it was that later As the miller told his tale That her face at first just ghostly Turned a whiter shade of pale",

When we met I was sure out to lunch Now, my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch And when the morning of the warning's passed The gassed and flaccid kids are flung across the stars The psychodramas and the traumas gone The songs are left unsung and hung upon the scars And then along comes Mary And does she want to see the stains The dead remains of all the pains she left the night before Or will their waking eyes reflect the lies And make them realize their urgent cry for sight no more?

On your mind I've seen the way men look at you When they think I don't see And it hurts to have them think that you're that kind But it's knowing that you're looking back That's really killing me Woman, oh, woman Have you got cheating on your mind? On your mind A woman wears a certain look When she is on the move And a man can always tell what's on her mind I hate to have to say it But that look's all over you Woman, oh, woman Have you got cheating on your mind? Oh, woman, oh, woman Have you got cheating on your mind?",
