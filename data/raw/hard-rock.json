Hard to stop the surmounting terror Is it really the end, not some crazy dream? Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming It's not easy to stop from screaming But words escape me when I try to speak Tears fall, but why am I crying? After all, I'm not afraid of dying Don't I believe that there never is an end? As the guards march me out to the courtyard Somebody cries from a cell, God be with you If there's a God, why has He let me go? As I walk, my life drifts before me And though the end is near, I'm not sorry Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away Mark my words, believe my soul lives on Don't worry now that I have gone I've gone beyond to seek the truth When you know that your time is close at hand Maybe then you'll begin to understand Life down here is just a strange illusion Yeah, yeah, yeah Hallowed be thy name Yeah, yeah, yeah Hallowed be thy name Yeah",

Instead of takin' a test, I took two to the chest Call me blind, but I didn't see it comin' Everybody was runnin', but I couldn't hear nothin' except Gun blasts, it happened so fast I don't really know this kid, though I sit by him in class Maybe this kid was reachin' out for love Or maybe for a moment, he forgot who he was Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged Whatever it was, I know it's because We are, we are We are the youth of the nation We are, we are We are youth of the nation We are, we are We are the youth of the nation We are, we are We are youth of the nation Little Suzy, she was only twelve She was given the world with every chance to excel Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell She might act kind of proud, but no respect for herself She finds love in all the wrong places The same situations, just different faces Changed up her pace since her daddy left her Too bad he never told her she deserved much better Johnny boy always played the fool He broke all the rules so you would think he was cool He was never really one of the guys No matter how hard he tried, often thought of suicide It's kind of hard when you ain't got no friends He put his life to an end, they might remember him then You cross the line and there's no turning back Told the world how he felt with the sound of a gat We are, we are We are the youth of the nation We are, we are We are youth of the nation We are, we are We are the youth of the nation We are, we are We are youth of the nation Who's to blame for the lives that tragedies claim? No matter what you say, it don't take away the pain That I feel inside, I'm tired of all the lies Don't nobody know why, it's the blind leadin' the blind Guess that's the way the story goes Will it ever make sense? Somebody's gotta know There's gotta be more to life than this There's gotta be more to everything I thought exists We are, we are, the youth of the nation We are, we are, youth of the nation We are, we are We are, we are the youth of the nation We are, we are We are, we are youth of the nation We are, we are We are, we are the youth of the nation The youth of the nation We are, we are We are, we are youth of the nation The youth of the nation We are, we are We are, we are the youth of the nation The youth of the nation We are, we are We are, we are youth of the nation The youth of the nation We are Youth of the nation We are Youth of the nation We are Youth of the nation We are",

As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat And lick the gravy We oil the jaws of the war machine And feed it with our babies The killer's breed or the demon's seed The glamour, the fortune, the pain Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain Don't you pray for my soul anymore Two minutes to midnight The hands that threaten doom Two minutes to midnight To kill the unborn in the womb The body bags and little rags Of children torn in two And the jellied brains of those who remain To put the finger right on you As the madmen play on words And make us all dance to their song To the tune of starving millions To make a better kind of gun The killer's breed or the demon's seed The glamour, the fortune, the pain Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain Don't you pray for my soul anymore Two minutes to midnight The hands that threaten doom Two minutes to midnight To kill the unborn in the womb Midnight, midnight Midnight, it's all night Midnight, midnight Midnight, it's all night Midnight, all night",

Everybody wants a bite Don't happen overnight So you wanna be a rock superstar? And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody Gotta look over your shoulder constantly I remember the days when I was a young kid growin' up Looking in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up The rock crowd, make money, chill with the honey's Sign autographs or whatever the people want from me Shit's funny how impossible dreams manifest And the games that be comin' with it, nevertheless You got to go for the gusto but you don't know About the blood, sweat and tears and losing some of your peers And losing some of yourself to the years past gone by Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy Egomaniac and the brainiac don't know how to act Shit's deep, 48 tracks Studio gangster mack signed the deal, thinks he's gonna make a mil' But never will till he crosses over Still filling your head with fantasies Come with me, show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese You wanna be a rock superstar in the biz? And take shit from people who don't know what it is I wish it was all fun and games but the price of fame is high And some can't pay the way Still trapped in what you rappin' about Tell me what happened when you lost clout The route you took started collapsing No fans, no fame, no respect, no change, no women And everybody shits on your name So you wanna be a rock superstar? And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody Gotta look over your shoulder constantly Be a rock superstar? And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody Gotta look over your shoulder constantly People see rock stars, you know what I'm sayin'? But you still... try'na... get out more, like, like everybody else, you know You know... it's a fun job, but it's still a job Save your money, man... save your money too Hit singles don't last very long, you nahmsayin'? I mean... you're lucky in this game too There's gon' be another cat comin' out Lookin' like me, soundin' like me, next year – I know this It'll be a flipside to what you did Somebody'll try to spin off like, some... series You ever have big dreams of makin' big cream? Big shot, heavy hitter on the mainstream You wanna look trendy in the Bentley Be a snob and never act friendly You wanna have big fame, let me explain What happens to these stars and their big brains First they get played like all damn day Long as you sell everything will be okay Then you get dissed by the media and fans Things never stay the same way they began I heard that some never give full to the fullest That's why fools end up dining on a bullet Think everything's fine in the big time See me in my Lex' with the chrome raised high So you wanna roll far and live large? It ain't all that goes with bein' a rock star So you wanna be a rock superstar? And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody Gotta look over your shoulder constantly To be a rock superstar? And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody Gotta look over your shoulder constantly My own son don't know me I'm chillin' in the hotel room lonely But I thank God I'm with my homies But sometimes I wish I was back home But only no radio or video didn't show me No love, the phony, gotta hit the road slowly So the record gets pushed by Sony I'm in the middle like Monie And the press say that my own people disown me And the best way back is to keep your head straight Never inflate the cranium They're too worried about them honies at the Palladium Who just wanna cling on, swing on, and so on Go on, fall off, the hoes roll on Till the next rock superstar with no shame Give him a year, he'll be right out the game The same as the last one who came before him Gained fame, started gettin' ignored, I warned him Assured him, this ain't easy take it from Weezy Sleezy people wanna be so cheesy, the fuckin' lethal Assassins, assassins So you wanna be a rock superstar? And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody Gotta look over your shoulder constantly To be a rock superstar? And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody Gotta look over your shoulder constantly",

Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned Place and time always on my mind I have so much to say, but you're so far away Plans of what our futures hold Foolish lies of growin' old It seems we're so invincible, the truth is so cold A final song, a last request A perfect chapter laid to rest Now and then, I try to find a place in my mind Where you can stay You can stay awake forever How do I live without the ones I love? Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned Place and time always on my mind I have so much to say, but you're so far away Sleep tight, I'm not afraid Not afraid The ones that we love are here with me Lay away a place for me Place for me 'Cause as soon as I'm done, I'll be on my way On my way To live eternally How do I live without the ones I love? Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned Place and time always on my mind And the light you left remains, but it's so hard to stay When I have so much to say, and you're so far away I love you, you were ready The pain is strong, and urges rise But I'll see you when He lets me Your pain is gone, your hands untied So far away And I need you to know So far away And I need you to, need you to know",
