By the way, sweetheart, what's your name? She said: My friends like to call me Exotic Elaine I said: My name is the Prince and she said: Why? I said: Well, I don't know, I'm just a hell of a guy! But enough about me, yo, let's talk about you And all the wonderful things that you and I can do I popped some trash and in a little bit of time I showed some cash and the girl was mine I took her over town, I wined her and dined her She asked me 'did I like her?' I said: Well... kinda All of a sudden, she jumped out her seat Snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street She started grabbin all over me, kissin' and huggin' So I shoved her away, I said: You better stop buggin'! She got mad, looked me dead in my face Threw her hands in the air and yelled out: Rape! I got scared when she started to yell So I handed her my wallet and ran like hell I was duckin' through alleys right and left But when the cops caught up, they almost beat me to death I was arrested, charged with aggravated assault Hey, yo Clancy, we got him! But it wasn't my fault! Nevertheless, don't mean to bust your bubble But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble So next time a girl gives you the play Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away I was in a bar one Friday night Coolin', watchin' a Mike Tyson fight I was maxin' and relaxin', sippin' on tequila When this girl walked up, she said: Hi, my name is Sheila I responded by saying hello She paid for my drink and then said: Let's go 20 minutes later, things were starting to cook As we pulled up into her house, I said: I'm with you, toots The music was soft and there was wine in the glasses She started winking and making little passes At me, she grabbed me close and that's when she got bold She started feeling up my back, I said: Oh, your hands are cold! We went into her bedroom thinking of one thing Took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring I carresed her body and I kissed her cheek And that's when I observed those satin bed sheets I felt that it was time for me to make my move I thought I better hurry up before I busted the groove I leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue A door slammed and a voice said: Baby, where are you? Her boyfriend busted in, he grinned an evil grin And said: Boy, I'mma tear your butt limb from limb! I was scared as hell, where was I supposed to go? I just yelled: Geronimo! and jumped out the window Just my luck we were in a snow storm And all I had was my underwear on to keep me warm And to top the night off, I had to break in my place Because my keys were in my pants back on Sheila's book case I was done, sneezin' and coughin'... Aaa-choo! I hope this doesn't happen too often, but Nevertheless, don't mean to bust your bubble But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble So next time a girl gives you the play Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away I got a ring on my phone, May 5th last year It was my girlfriend Betty, I said: Hello dear!

I sat there for at least an hour It was ten after nine before she got in the shower 9:35, she comes downstairs And said: I need a little longer to finish my hair At ten o'clock, we had been missed the show She comes downstairs and says 'let's go'!? Go where? Go to sleep, I'm gone!
