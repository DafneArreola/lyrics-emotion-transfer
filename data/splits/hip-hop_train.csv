hip-hop,2Pac,Dear Mama,"You are appreciated When I was young, me and my mama had beef Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place Suspended from school, and scared to go home I was a fool, with the big boys breakin' all the rules I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years We was poorer than the other little kids And even though we had different daddies, the same drama When things went wrong we'd blame Mama I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell And who'd think in elementary, hey I'd see the penitentiary one day? And runnin' from the police, that's right Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside And even as a crack fiend, Mama You always was a black queen, Mama I finally understand For a woman, it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it There's no way I can pay you back But the plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated Lady, don't you know we love ya? Dear Mama Sweet lady, place no one above ya You are appreciated Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

I won't hesitate to diss one or two before I'm through So don't try to sing this Some drop science, well, I'm droppin' English Even if Yella makes it a cappella I still express, yo, I don't smoke weed or sess 'Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage And brain damage on the mic don't manage nothin' But makin' a sucka and you equal, don't be another sequel Express yourself Ah, ah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah Express yourself Smoke, smoke Come on and do it Yeah, kick it over here Express yourself Do it, do it, for the bag, for the bag Express yourself Come on and do it Now, gettin' back to the PG That's program, and it's easy Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow Expressin' ain't their subject because they like to follow The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin Again and again and again — yo, you on the other end Watch a brother blend dope rhymes with no help There's no fessin' and guessin' while I'm expressin' myself It's crazy to see people be What society wants 'em to be, but not me Ruthless is the way to go, they know Others say rhymes that fail to be original Or they kill where the hip-hop starts Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts Though some musicians cuss at home But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone Yeah, they want reality, but you won't hear none They'd rather exaggerate a little fiction Some say no to drugs and take a stand But after the show, they go lookin' for the dopeman Or they ban my group from the radio Hear N.W.A and say Hell no! But you know, it ain't all about wealth As long as you make a note to... Express yourself Yeah, yeah, brothers always beefin', fall victim to the streets Express yourself Come on and do it Yeah, yeah, do it Express yourself Dr. Dre, Dr. Dre in full effect and N.W.A Express yourself Come on and do it Express yourself From the heart 'cause if you wanna start to move up the chart Then expression is a big part of it You ain't efficient when you flow You ain't swift, movin' like a tortoise full of rigor mortis There's a little bit more to show I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo Or a lesson, all of 'em expression And if you start fessin', I got a Smith & Wesson for you I might ignore your record because it has no bottom I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn It's Dre on the mic, gettin' physical Doin' the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob Yes, I'm macabre but you know you need this And the knowledge is growin', just like a fetus Or a tumor, but here's the rumor Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good When I start expressin' myself — Yella, slam it!
